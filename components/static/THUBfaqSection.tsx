      <h1 className="">What are tokenomics?</h1>
      <p className="">
        When a problem is solved value is created. Tokenomics look at how that
        value is distributed/shared/moved between different users involved.
        Essentially tokenomics are a set of rules or conditions that determine
        how value flows within a protocol. If you’re interested in getting a
        better understanding of tokenomics you can check out our Intro to
        Tokenomics course.

      <h2>What is Tokenomics Hub?</h2>
      <p>
        Tokenomics Hub is a library and platform of community-sourced tokenomics
        reports of leading crypto and web3 protocols. These reports give users a
        quick and easy way to get a clear understanding of what a protocol’s
        tokenomics mean.
      </p>
      <h1>How to evaluate tokenomics?</h1>
      <p>
        There are 5 major things to consider when evaluating tokenomics; the
        token utility or how the token is used in the protocol, demand drivers
        or where demand for the token will come, value capture or how the token
        will capture the value created by the protocol, business model or how
        value is being shared between different users and the protocol and
        finally token distribution and allocations along with their respective
        vesting schedules.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tokenomics Hub reports are based on these 5 aspects to provide an
        easy-to-understand and to-the-point analysis of a protocol’s tokenomics
      </p>
      <h2>What is token utility?</h2>
      <p>
        Token utility can be thought of as the token use case or how the token
        is used in the protocol. Examples include token used for governance, pay
        for gas, as staking requirement for a node operation in proof of stake,
        membership access and more.
      </p>
      <h1>How do you design tokenomics for your cryptocurrency?</h1>
      <p>
        To begin, you have to assess the viability of a token's for your
        project. Then, analyze the target market and user base, which includes
        investors. Next, align the user base with the protocol's long-term
        sustainability through incentive structures (aka tokens).
        <br />
        <br />
        Though the process may seem complex due to the numerous variables and steps,
        the Tokenomics Design Space simplifies it by offering an easily
        comprehensible framework for designing tokenomics.
      </p>
      <h2>What is token utility?</h2>
      <p>
        A crucial aspect of designing good tokenomics lies in comprehending the
        motivations and actions of your user base when engaging with your
        protocol. The objective is to establish a mutually beneficial
        relationship between users and the protocol. By gaining insight into
        their underlying motivations and intended tasks, you can develop
        incentive structures that promote desirable behaviours and discourage
        unfavourable ones, all in the best interest of the protocol. This
        encompasses various elements, including allocations for investors,
        vesting schedules, and incentive frameworks, among others.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Tokenomics Design Space was meticulously developed by leveraging the
        experience of Tokenomics DAO in designing tokenomics, providing a
        a user-friendly approach to creating robust tokenomics solutions.
