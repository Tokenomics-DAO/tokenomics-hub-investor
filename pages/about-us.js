            We strive to answer the key question of tokenomics: why do some
            tokens/projects/communities work and others fail? We are building an
            ever-expanding tokenomics framework to help reduce risk and increase
            transparency.

            We believe in the power of the hive-mind and prefer to source all
            talent and know-how from our community. It is our goal to set up a

            Tokenomics DAO.
